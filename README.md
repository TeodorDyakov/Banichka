A toy supervised classfication library that I created, because I was curious how Machine Learning alogrtihms actually do their magic.  
Implemented algorithms : 
1. K-nearest neigbor
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Nearest centroid
4. ZeroR
5. Multiclass Perceptron(not to be confused with Multilayer Perceptron)
6. Quadratic Discrimant Analysis
