A toy supervised classfication library that I created, because I was curious how Machine Learning alogrtihms actually do their magic.  
Implemented algorithms : 
* K-nearest neigbor
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Nearest centroid
* ZeroR
* Multiclass Perceptron(not to be confused with Multilayer Perceptron)
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
